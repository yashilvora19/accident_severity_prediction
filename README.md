# Predicting Severity of Road Accidents

### Abstract 
One of the leading causes of non natural death is road accidents. There may be several contributing factors that lead to vehicle casualties, including traffic, weather, road conditions etc. We wanted to predict the severity of road accidents ranging from Slight, Serious, to Fatal using supervised models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees etc. Attributes that may be used to predict the data include the road conditions, the weather conditions, vehicle types, or what kind of area they’re in. 

Our data is mainly focused on locations in the UK, so while it may not necessarily apply similarly in the US, we could still use this model to run on US datasets and see the results. It is a dataset with 14 columns and over 600k observations, with columns including severity of accident, the date, number of casualties, longitude/ latitude, road surface conditions, road types, urban/ rural areas, weather conditions, and vehicle types. Ethical concerns include if our stakeholders were vehicle companies, would they have reduced sales if, say, trucks were more likely to lead to severe accidents? However, by figuring out what would predict the severity of road accidents, we can also prevent harm by noting the features that largely impact the severity. 

### Visualization Steps

We made use of the pairplot and heatmap with correlation matrix in order to get an overall sense of the distribution of data. Through this we were also able to get correlations between different features and became one with the data. We were able to see trends and patterns through a few more visualizations of light intensities VS number of accidents, number of casualties VS number of vehicles, and how the number of accidents varied over the past 4 years. 

All of this collectively gave us a better idea of what the data looks like which in turn gives us a better idea of which models to use in the next step of this project.

### Preprocessing Steps
We already began preprocessing the data by one hot encoding most of the categorical data (`Road_Surface_Conditions`, `Road_Type`, `Urban_or_Rural_Area`, `Vehicle_Type`), and for `Light_Conditions`, we chose to make it ordinal and encode it from 0 for Dark, and 3 for Daylight. We selected MultiBinarizer to do multiple one-hot encoding for each row for the `Weather Conditions` as there were multiple categories that were satistified. Then we chose to normalize the `Latitude` and `Longitude` to make it a more contained value. We left the `Number_of_Casualties` and `Number_of_Vehicles` as is, as the values were just integers and seemed to have no large outliers.

#### Standardizing 
We finished up standardizing our data this week. We chose to use standardization as our preprocessing technique due to the following reasons:
1. Our data didn't follow a normal distribution, hence standardizing it was imperative in order to get accurate results.
2. Maining the relationship between datapoints is also important, and since standardization doesn't distort our data distribution, it works well for preprocessing.
3. Standardization also takes into account outliers, which will again make our model better.

### Logistic Regression
In our project, we our trying to classify accidents into the following categories:

1. Mild
2. Severe
3. Fatal

Since this is a classification task, we chose logistic regression as our machine learning model.

Our model analyses the given data (42 columns) and outputs 0 is the accident is classified as 'slight', 1 if it is 'serious', and 2 if it is 'fatal'. We use multiclass logistic regression since there are more than 2 labels. 

We chose logistic regression because of the following reasons:

1. Simplicity: It's easy to implement, and is also one of the first models we learnt in class. 
2. Efficiency: It is known to be a very popular classification model for categorical data, which is what we are focusing on. It is also very fast.
3. Accuracy: It also provides a probability for each outcome, which makes it easier to understand how confident the model is in its predictions.


### Next steps: Other Classification Models

Our next step would be to compare our results from this model to those of other classification models like Neural Networks, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM. By comparing our results, we would get a better understanding of a range of classification models, which would further help us determine which one works the best for our data.
